# Pedantix

This small project is a clone of the [Pedantix](https://pedantix.certitudes.org/) website. I made it for learning purposes not to compete the original version. If you like the project, please go check out their website.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Pradene/pedantix
    ```

2. Install the dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
    ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
